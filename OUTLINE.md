# function tia(theHero)- Outline

##### This is a repo for the novel that I am writing during [National Novel Writing Month](http://nanowrimo.org/) where I am committed to 50,000 words by November 30. 

######_Summary_ 

Tiandra Williams is a Black, awkward, sarcastic, funloving thirtysomething web developer in San Francisco, working for a food tech company in the city. As a little girl, Tiandra (or Tia, as she goes by for simplicity) has been aware of her innate ability to read machine languages as easily as a picture book, and excelled in math and computer sciences throughout her scolastic career. Because it was frowned upon to be a "nerd" in school, Tia downplayed her ability, and gets by as a moderately good developer tucked away in the recesses of her office doing testing grunt work. She doesn't fit into her office culture at all, avoids speaking engagements and diversity chats, and often finds herself the butt of jokes. She has a fond appreciation for cats, travel, Dunkaccinos, and the color yellow. 

Tia has a small group of friends- her wild and inhibitionless best friend Estelle, and her calm, cool, and collected best friend Edward are the two she spends the most time with. Tia fits in with the group directly in the middle- she loves to have a good time with Estelle, and enjoys quiet moments with Ed, and offers helpful advice and a great listening ear to both. Tia is a single lesbian, and her dating life has been full of misadventures with crazy experiences that her friends often tease her about. 

During a normal day of work, as Tia ventures out for coffee her and her peers' computers are overtaken by a youtube broadcast- a hacker group called FEWD has warned Americans that their food supply is being poisoned, and they intend to set things right by purging the nanotechnology and production centers across the country. The hackers have devised a way to simultaneously let out a poisonous substance that would kill workers, executives, and all associated with the production and sale of processed foods, and gives a deadline of one month to educate society in healthy food production and farming before all processed food production halts. 

Through the course of the day, the President announces that grocery stores would be opened only voluntarily and that food processing facilities would be shut down immediately and until the situation is neutralized. A chain reaction happens- restaurants close, grocery stores close, and people start to horde microwaveable and canned foods, rationing them off and selling for obscene prices. 

One of the senior developers of Tia's company and a former hacktivist, Bill Mayer, manages to trace the source of the youtube video virus and comes across a challenging code puzzle, buried deep within source code. Feeling powerless against what is happening, Tia trudges on until she happens to encounter Bill and learn about the code challenge. They discover that figuring out the challenge will stop the poisoning and hysteria over lost lunchmeat, and Tia begins to reveal her ability to read code. 

As Tia starts to decipher the code and figure out how to meet the hackers' demands, her life starts to change. People start to recognize and celebrate her talents, she feels more empowered as a person, and she meets a woman, Lisa, who helps her to relax and believe in herself.

 The hackers notice Tia's talent, and after she has deciphered the code and submitted a successful solution, they up the ante and require a real and actionable solution to the processed food problem within 72 hours. After learning how much everyone depends on her, Tiandra has a moment of doubt and fear, not sure that her ability would allow her to write something so important, so quickly. With the help of her coworkers, friends, and her girlfriend, she manages to create an app that solves the problem, increasing her wealth, fame, and ultimately satisfying the hackers who are soon after apprehended and the poisonous substances removed from target facilities.

As the novel concludes, Tiandra settles down with her love interest and becomes an instructor, teaching young, diverse children how to code. She is recognized as a hero, but finds her greatest reward in being able to enhance the lives of others.
