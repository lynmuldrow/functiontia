##### This is a repo for the novel that I am writing during [National Novel Writing Month](http://nanowrimo.org/) where I am committed to 50,000 words by November 30.

Ok, so here I’ll start to like, write like I’m in the moment, as much as I can remember. It was only two years ago- I think I can just add some little embellishments as I go along, if I forget some things.

Today was unlike any other day, with the exception of the stand-ups- Kip decided to institute Agile Development, so now I have to act like I enjoy communicating with my teammates more often than once a week. As I indulged in my flavor of the month (this month I chose the pumpkin spice k-cups), the walls around me seemed to fall and the faint smell of beach air wafted about my cubby space. I felt my hand, tingling from the cold, and lifted my coffee mug to discover a taste of crisp, cool Corona garnished with lime. A deep yet feminine voice whispered among the breeze, coming in clearer as my fantasy enraptured me, “Tia...TIA?” 

“Oh, oh hey Kip! How’s your day? I was just visualizing this documentation in hopes that it would get clearer,” I stammered, the cold, egg-white walls closing in on me as my boss loomed over my chair. 

“Hey, Tia! You were in la la land there, huh? Good thing we managed to get you this space in the far corner of the office- great for spacing out. Anyway, we’re gonna need a SCRUM Master  for this next project, and I thought you’d be perfect for it. Weren’t you an administrative assistant in the past, or something like that? It’s not that tough.” 

Usually when Kip talks, I envision some sort of torture being bestowed upon him with me as executioner. I could take it old school and just bludgeon him with a huge hammer. Or maybe the pendulum- he’d spew asinine ideas while a pendulum crept menacingly close to his vital organs. 

“I didn’t do any administrative work save for balancing books at Pop’s corner store, but I think I could probably figure it out. Is there like a Master manual or something?” I attempted at a warm smile, but it came out more like a grimace. 

Kip shrugged. “I’m positive that Google would have the answer there. We’ll need you for the 3pm meeting, so if you could have an idea on how you’d like to start guiding the sprints, that would be ‘wassup!’”

Did he really just say wassup? Is that what we do to be relevant to the brown girl? I don’t even say wassup. I don’t even know if I’m pronouncing it right in my head. Literally, I think most of the street cred that I built up in my middle school (I was kicked out of class 3 times- take that, Mommy) has since dissipated, save for the times I experience violent word vomit during 90s rap songs. 

“Yeah, definitely wassup? I’ll uhm, have some things ready by 3. Hey, awesome cupcakes last week- I still have a few in my fridge! Thanks, Kip.” I nodded and started to turn toward my iMac, hopefully wrapping things up well enough to prompt Kip to leave. 

Kip perked up, and I could have sworn he gave himself a hug. “Really? You liked them? They were gluten-free, non-dairy, organic, jicama bean pumpkin cupcakes. I thought the recipe was a bit hard to follow, so I wasn’t sure. Thanks, Tia!” 

As he flounced out, my phone vibrated. Estelle. What time was it? Already 10am. I have absolutely no idea what it means to be a SCRUM Master. Ugh, at the times when I feel like this job could kiss my brown round, I remember that I live in San Francisco, where everything is unquestionably expensive and you remember that vividly each time you hand over a rent payment.

I popped out of my moderately comfy, ergonomic chair to pace down the hall while on the phone. There was always some cheesy elevator music humming in the background, and the chatter level is typically unusually constant for an office of developers, so using the phone in the hall is not a thing. Plus, I needed a tad bit of de-stress time after Kip reminded me how stereotypes are real. 

“Stell? Hey girl. Are you at work?” I looked down at my nails while waiting for her response. I’m so bad at being a girl sometimes- my navy matte polish was starting to chip. 

“Tia boo, yes! Slaving away for the Man over here- You? Oh well, I know you’re at work. When is the last time you even took a day off? Estelle’s voice seemed cheery 90% of the time, even when she was in one of her misadventures with whatever interests her at the time. Right now, she is taking up mountain climbing and getting over a bad breakup by binging on exercise. 

“Yep, work as usual. Can you believe Kip said ‘weren’t you an admin assistant in your past?’ Girl, he actually said that to me, like nonchalantly while adding more to my plate. Way to diminish my contributions to your team, guy. I try not to take things personally, but I fear one day he’s going to just yell ‘Mammie’ and run down the hall quoting The Wire.” 

Stell laughed heartily, but I could hear her breath intensifying in the background. “Yeah, that dude has like no filter. He probably has a Black mama. Anyway, have you heard that Leon is dating that one girl you messed with? Princess? Something like that. They’re walking around like he didn’t cheat on me, all out in the open, hand and hand and such.” 

“Estelle Victoria, wait- did you play hookey from work? I could’ve sworn I heard a treadmill in the background. And is that grunting? You must be at Planet Fitness. The one in the Financial District? I’m on my way.” I hung up the phone and padded back to my office to grab my bag. One of the best things about being relatively invisible in the office is that, aside from your contributions being unnoted, you could come and go as you please. I figured no one would miss me for 20 minutes- I had to catch up with my homegirl.

The air was crisp and there was a cold breeze causing my curls to float and dance in the air like in the commercials. That was one thing about my new home- while dreaming of California as a young woman, I never expected there to be cold weather. Of course, the cold of the northeast and what I consider cold in San Francisco is completely different, but the mid- 50s now prompted a thick cardigan or light coat. I haven’t gotten to the point where bubble coats in this weather is a necessity, but I felt my fingers a bit frigid as I walked around the corner to the gym. 

There was Estelle, my best friend since grade school. How we managed to make it out here around the same time is crazy- both of us were lured to San Francisco by exes who made us feel like forever was a possibility. Her with Trent, a charming bore of a guy- a project manager at some new startup who wore weed socks and listened to DnB way too much. Me, well there was Alana. Oh, Alana. She went by Ace because Alana was too feminine, but Alana fit better. A stud, or masculine-aligned woman who in popular terms is deemed a tomboy, Ace would never be caught dead in a dress or heels, but required I wear them. ‘Required’ is why we’re no longer together. 

Estelle is what I’d consider an enigma. Although we’re confirmed in that we’re very different, it’s hard to pinpoint her personality. She’s ever-changing but always fun to be around. And she’s gorgeous. Stell is about 5’ 10”, 140 lbs soaking wet, with not a drop of fat on her body. Once, in 8th grade, she’d gained a considerable amount of puberty weight and immediately lost it, vowing never to be that big again. Her rich, chocolatey skin illuminated against her hourglass frame, and her plump, pink lips and long natural hair made her modelesque beside me. I have always felt like the frumpy one, and as I walked up to her breaking a sweat at the eliptical machine with my bear claw in hand, I felt awash with self fat-shaming phrases. 

“Girl, you’re always in the gym. Want a bite of this bear claw? I promise you’ll work it off.” I smacked Stell’s butt playfully- we went there once, but it was gross. I keep my gayness to myself mostly, save for the times we have relationship chats. 

“Hey pumpkin! Yeah, let me get a bite of that!” She leaned down and took a huge bite of the pastry, closing her eyes as I can imagine the sugar rushed through her body. “Yeah, so Princess- can you believe that lame wench had the audacity to date both of our exes? I mean, she should pick a side! Right?” 

I chuckled. Princess was such a slut. She was Prince when I dated her, and honestly she was more ‘The Artist Formerly Known As’ rather than, a fully masculine prince. She was a knight in tainted armor, appealing for love across gender lines as her deep hatred of self was tucked neatly into her helmet. I enjoy androgyny, and have even dated men who were more female leaning- I like souls before genders, but for simplicity’s sake I deem myself a lesbian. Prince(ss) found a way into my heart, held onto it for a few months, and promptly discarded it when she decided I was too boring. I didn’t disagree- I let her go, and a few months later she was an accessory dangling from Trent’s arm. 

“Yeah, she should pick a side, but what can you do? I think her and Trent will make an amazing pair- I’ve seen them around Castro for some reason- once at the Theater for a Diversity In Tech talk, and another time at the adult shop there.” I frowned, remembering how they caught me with ‘Big Bubba.’ “I think Princess just follows the money- we’re not bad off and nor is Trent. I just can’t believe she’s so...girly.”
