##### This is a repo for the novel that I am writing during [National Novel Writing Month](http://nanowrimo.org/) where I am committed to 50,000 words by November 30.

I wasn’t always a boring teacher. Sometimes, sitting in this dimly lit, horribly decorated community college classroom, I fantasize about my past and the time I was a hero. I thought about maybe writing a book about it, but honestly it doesn’t seem as interesting as I see it in my head. Mildly attractive nerd with a slight overbite and odd ability to read code saves the world. Ha, saves the world. I literally did just that, and here I am on a Tuesday evening, teaching Scratch to nonprofit workers. Not that there’s anything wrong with what I do- in fact, I turned down a stupid nice offer from Google for a freelance teaching gig. It’s just, weird I suppose. Shouldn’t I be out continuing to do good, and not scribbling in this journal? 

Well, maybe this journal can become a book. A gift from Kim, my peace. The one who knows me best, who knew more about me in that moment than I knew about myself. Maybe I’ll recap here and use whatever I wrote for a book. Hopefully someone will be patient enough to sort through my typos. 

Yeah, that’s a good idea.

I guess it started a little after I got my first job. Like a good girl, I did the traditional route- achieved a full ride scholarship to an HBCU, graduated with honors, and went on to become a fast food worker. Don’t we all start out that way nowadays? The promise of a good “career job,” like my mom would put it, is over. Unless your dad, uncle, or other paternal figure has a high stake in the company, you’re stuck taking what you can get to satisfy your ¼ of the rent and bills in your “graduated dorm room” of an apartment. 

I can remember, job interview after job interview with tech companies who had no idea how to interview me. A curvy black girl with wild, long black ringlets sprouting from her head, bespeckled and freckled, light brown skin just light enough not to be threatening, and tiny little lips that barely fit my face. What do you say to that, after glancing through a resume well beyond that of your senior developer and being confronted with all of that raw, visceral blackness in your face? You say no, or “you’re not a culture fit,” or “your experience is a perfect fit but we’ve decided to go with someone else who is a little more perfect.” 

I remember even adjusting my resume after every failed interview. See, in elementary school, Ms. Douglass, my second grade teacher, noticed that I was really, really good at math. For some reason, while other little girls were told to have a hard time with arithmetic, I didn’t have a chance to be conditioned to feel threatened. It was as if the numbers and their operations floated around in my head and whispered the answers to me, one by one. Those two minute math tests? I finished them in 30 seconds. Ms. Douglass followed my elementary school journey and introduced me to Matheletes, Robotics Camp, and programming. I’ve been writing Java since I was 10, and I read code like I read those celeb gossip sites. But there I was, dumbing down my resume. 
One position listing- freelance web developer. Years of experience? It was really 10, but I wrote four. I left out my masters’, added less school accomplishments, and added random hobbies. If I could get a job with a big company that let me sit by the window and do grunt work, my team members won’t feel threatened by how stereotypically “big boned Lisa Bonet” I look and consider my skills to be so junior that I wouldn’t reach their level any time soon. Because that’s what I got all through college- the jolly, 6 foot, black giant in a sea of white getting straight A’s and continually having to prove my ability to inflate the egos of culturally accepted “tech nerds” who felt threatened by my existence. I’ll get a job because of diversity, and will do just enough to be the second pick for the “face of diversity” because of my accomplishments. That’s what I thought. Think? Maybe I should start writing in like, present tense, so that it’ll seem like you’re right there with me. I’ll edit this out later. 

So, the job interview that landed me the position at Gigli. It was honestly the most awkward thing I have ever experienced in my life. That day I looked a little less like a hippie- I was going for chic naturalista business casual, but my baggy-in-the-crotch-area black pants and tits-busting-from-my-collar shirt made me more fidgety than poised. As I sat alone in the dry, plainly designed meeting room, I pulled out a clear rubber band from one of the fake locs I made toward the front of my hair to secure a renegade button. As I affixed the rubber band on the shirt’s button, the interviewers strode in and startled me, popping open my top to expose my pink bra. 

“Oh, oh my God yo, I mean sir, I mean my bad, sorry, sorry,” or something to that effect managed to spout out of my plum colored lips as I hastily popped the button back in. 

“Tia? Nice to uhm, meet you! No problem- please, have a seat.” The president of the company gave me a firm handshake, and through my black girl blushing I managed an awkward smile. 

There were five on the panel- Kip Zuckers (whose name induces a knot in my throat), the CEO of Gigli, Pete, Dave, and Ken- three of the four BroYo’s (dudes who seem to think “Jersey Shore x Dev Nerds” are a thing), and Breath. I can never remember that guy’s real name, but I’ve called him Breath since this interview, given the unpleasant, garbage can parfum wafting from his lips at all times. Rapid fire questions happened- the ones that don’t matter at all but test your judgement.

 “Are you self taught? I see you freelanced for four years,” Breath asked through the barrage of questions. He seemed to be looking at me a bit more intensely than the others, but I was never able to pick up on it. 

“Well, no. I attended Spelman for Computer Science, and got a ma-” I stopped and caught myself- this was the resume I butchered. “I received a lot of clients right after school who helped in advancing my knowledge.” 

Breath, a slender, dark-skinned, middle eastern man who looked attractive enough (if you like that sort of thing) stared on as I spoke, and I couldn’t tell if there was a salad leaf in my teeth or what. I finished my sentence and promptly looked down, wondering what in the hell he was examining. Was it my hair? It was on point that day- fluffy and curly, it reaches my middle back and has six chunky locs adorned with cowrie shells. Given my close Puerto Rican roots, I have the sort of hair that’s thick enough to make a nice curly bush, but thin enough to flat iron to perfection. Maybe it was my shirt? Just as I looked down, my button popped again. 

After letting out a loud laugh-snort. I got through the interview and I’ll never forget what Kip said to me, after extending his hand for an offer. “We’ll give you a shot, Tia Andria, is it? I expect big things from you- push beyond what you all are capable of. You have a lot of people riding on your success.” 

My first reaction made my knees buckle. Should I just punch him in the face? Should I withdraw my hand from this sweaty handshake and walk away? Or should I take the job before FeatherDawn and Heather decide to kick me out of their flat in the Mission? I wanted to let him know that despite how intentionally mediocre I performed on the whiteboard test, my brain is capable of the same functioning. A lot of people riding on my success? What does that even mean, dude? And it’s TEE- AWN- DRUH. That’s why I go by Tia, because the sound of my name being mispronounced sounds like nails on a chalkboard. Obviously though, despite Kip’s naively racist remark, I took the job. I wouldn’t find a room less than $1,800 a month in that area, and my “You Did It” fund was running dry. Mom would have a fit if I asked for more money. Besides, the BroYo crew didn’t ask too many stupid questions, so I suppose as long as I fit in and stay away from Kip, I’ll be good.

Gigli. We make a specialized tracking system for levels of nanotechnology present in widely consumed foods, with easily consumable data structures for integration in existing enterprise software. Simple version- we make tools for nanotech engineers and conspiracy theorists. Kip got the name from that super corny movie with Bennifer, because he watched it nonstop while coding the MVP at an accelerator house in Palo Alto. I feel utterly disgusted whenever I tell someone where I work, because for some reason, Kip feels like he’s the CEO of Facebook or something. 

Typically the response I get after telling people where I work is, “Oh, that tech company with that annoying, fake Steve Jobs, named after that corny movie,” to which I hastily nod and look down in shame. The only redeeming quality of my job, besides the fact that I have the corner office/cubby thing near two big windows with an actual chair (everyone else sits on exercise balls or stands), is that I’m the only generalist. I have more fun in the back-end, but thanks to my mom’s incessant prodding and encouragement to be well-rounded by infusing arts education into my rigorous science/math focus, I am damn good with design and the front-end as well. The best part of my day comes right after my morning K-cup, when at least three of my teammates have to specifically seek me out to ask me a question. It almost makes me as giddy as finding the perfect vintage blazer at that big thrift store on Mission St.
