##### This is a repo for the novel that I am writing during [National Novel Writing Month](http://nanowrimo.org/) where I am committed to 50,000 words by November 30. 

I'll push each contribution per day in a separate file, with the word count. I've wanted to write a novel for a long time, and this is the push I need to do it! 

Read along and feel free to submit some words of encouragement, grammar edits, or comments on this readme - I need it!
